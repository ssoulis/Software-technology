The project report and the comments were originally written  in Greek and were translated by me so there may be some mistakes in the traslated version (grammar) :)

USER INSTRUCTIONS:

For the project description open the 3)Project-Description-v1.0.docx file, in the 12)Class-Diagram v1.0.docx there is a section with all the methods used in the code explained.

The code implemantation is not finished because we had only 4 months for the whole project, the project idea is relatively large for the given time.Despite that the important operations are running smoothly.

Thank you for your time!
